# musical-couscous-plasma-speaker-
Plasma speker using a flyback transformer.
This plasma speaker uses a schmits trigger to convert a sinusoidal music signal to a square signal. This signal can then be used to interupt a oscillator based on a 555 timer circuit, whose frequncy can be tuned from 14-32kHz.
The flyback transformer has a custom primary coil wound on its exposed ferrite core. This coil has an inductance of around 170uH and along with 3x0.1uf capacitors makes a resonant tank with a frequency of 22kHz.
